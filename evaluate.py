# 3. Intelligibility
# This would require subjective listening tests or objective metrics like STOI or PESQ
# You could use a library like PyAudio or PySoundFile to play the audio and collect user ratings

# 4. Speaker Verification
# This would require a pre-trained speaker verification model
# You could use a library like PyTorch or TensorFlow to load the model and evaluate the generated speech
# The output would be a score or a binary decision (accept/reject)
